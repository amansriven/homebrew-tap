  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Sticky only sees permission requests made while it is recording.
      Start recording in the background (runs as you; no sudo or Full Disk Access):
        sticky install-agent

      After upgrading Sticky, run `sticky install-agent` again to restart the
      recorder on the new version.

      When an app keeps asking for a permission, or silently lost one:
        sticky why <app>
